This was the final project for the introductory class to my graduate program. The poject explores two data sets on the movement of commerical goods in the U.S. via waterways in an R environment. The project was intended as an exercise in telling a story with data, and a opportunity to showcase our new data carpentry and basic visualization skills.

I had never written any code in R, or any other language for that matter, prior to this course.
