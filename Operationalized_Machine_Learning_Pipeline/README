This Python notebook is an example of an operationalized machine learning pipeline leaning heavliy on the Sci-kit Learn package. This notebook was a project for an Applid Machine Learning course, as evidenced by the Markdowns. The data consist of unspecified product types and statistics. The project called for the development of a classification model to predict product backorder status. The dataset was comprised of roughly 1.8 million observations. Three classification models were trained and tested on a sample subset, and a top performer was chosen. In addition to developing an operational ML pipeline, this project was an exercise in modeling imbalanced date: only 0.67% of the observations were TRUE for backorder status. In this situation it was important to not rely solely on the accuracy measure as evidence of successful modelling.
