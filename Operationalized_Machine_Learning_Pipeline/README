This is the final project for my Applied Machine Learning course. The project called for developing a classifier model to predict whether or not products would go on backorder. A roughly 1.8 million observation dataset was split into training and testing subsets. From there, 3 models were trained on the training set, one was chosen as a best performer and used to predict on the testing set. The results were analyzed and a conclusion written up, as well as recommendations for a simulated business report. Fairly extensive data carpentry was also necessary to fit the data into the models. While the notebook did hold a framework established by the faculty, I did add additional commented lines and Raw NBConvert cells where needed to provide sufficient commentary on what was going on in the workflow.
