This is the final project for my Applied Machine Learning course. The project called for developing a classifier model to predict whether or not products would go on backorder. A roughly 1.8 million observation dataset was split into training and testing subsets. From there, 3 models were trained on the training set, one was chosen as a best performer and used to predict on the testing set. The results were analyzed and a conclusion written up, as well as recommendations for a simulated business report. Fairly extensive data carpentry was also necessary to fit the data into the models. While the notebook did hold a framework established by the faculty, I did add additional commented lines and Raw NBConvert cells where needed to provide sufficient commentary on what was going on in the workflow. This project was completed in Python and made extensive use of the scikit-learn library.
This Python notebook is an example of an operationalized machine learning pipeline leaning heavliy on the Sci-kit Learn package. This notebook was a project for an Applid Machine Learning course, as evidenced by the Markdowns. The data consist of unspecified product types and statistics. The project called for the development of a classification model to predict product backorder status. The dataset was comprised of roughly 1.8 million observations. Three classifier models were trained and tested on a sample subset.
