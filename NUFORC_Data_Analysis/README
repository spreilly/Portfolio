This analysis was the final project for my first visualization class. I chose a data set from Kaggle that was scraped from the National UFO Reporting Center website that included over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings from 1910 to 2014, and included geospatial coordinates. The project was a good exercise in data carpentry on a large data set, as well as producing visualizations. The final submission included a copy of the R notebook and PDF infographic found here.
